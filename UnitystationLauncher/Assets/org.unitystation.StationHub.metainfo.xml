<description>
	<p>StationHub is a server browser and installation manager for the open-source game Unitystation.</p>
	<p>
		Based on cult classic Space Station 13, Unitystation is a multiplayer RPG about life in deep space. 
		Be an engineer, lawyer, surgeon or clown and keep the station safe from saboteurs. 
		Each round is filled with paranoia and lighthearted fun, even as you get thrown out the airlock.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The game is full of paranoia and lighthearted shenanigans, being a station that is as much at risk from clowns and mimes as it is from undercover operatives, eldritch cultists, changelings, demons, revolutions, and assaults from enemy corporations. 
		Played in rounds that reset the station every time, the game features an assortment of jobs, including doctors, chemists, scientists, janitors, engineers, atmospheric technicians, security guards, bartenders and the all-important clown.
